## :wrench: Framework and Implementation Details

"Avalon: Elemental Dragon's Odyssey" is built using **OpenGL**, a powerful cross-platform graphics API commonly used for rendering 2D and 3D graphics. Written in **C/C++**, OpenGL provides developers with low-level access to graphics hardware, allowing for high-performance rendering and real-time graphics applications.

The game's camera movement is implemented in [`camera.cpp`](GameEngine/Camera) and [`camera.h`](GameEngine/Camera), providing players with smooth and intuitive control over Avalon's perspective within the immersive worlds. This functionality enhances the player's experience, allowing for seamless exploration and interaction with the environment.

To enhance the user interface and provide helpful hints and quest updates, the **ImGui** library is utilized, offering a versatile and customizable GUI system that integrates seamlessly with OpenGL applications.

Incorporating 3D models and textures sourced from websites like **Sketchfab**, **CGTrader**, and **TurboSquid**, the game's assets are stored in the *Resources* folder, organized into *Models* and *Textures* subfolders. These assets are loaded into the game using [`mesh.cpp`](GameEngine/Model Loading) and [`loadObjMesh.cpp`](GameEngine/Model Loading), allowing for immersive environments.

Lighting within the game is handled by the [`shader.cpp`](GameEngine/Shaders) files and **GLSL** shaders located in the *Shaders* folder. These components work together to create dynamic lighting effects, adding realism to the elemental realms Avalon traverses.

## :book: Game Lore

"Avalon: Elemental Dragon's Odyssey" unfolds on the distant planet known as **Drakonia**, nestled among the stars of the cosmos. This world is inhabited by majestic dragons, each possessing unique elemental breath abilities. However, Drakonia's balance is disrupted when a group of mischievous pixies from a neighboring star system spill into the realm through a cosmic anomaly. These pixies, harboring great magical powers, seek to consume Drakonia, transforming it into a whimsical realm filled with enchanted forests and sparkling waters.

The lone observer of these events is **Z'Olrath** üîÆ, a cosmic wanderer from the planet Xylothar. Witnessing Drakonia's plight, Z'Olrath embodies the magic of the pixies within himself to prevent the planet's destruction. However, this transformation comes with its challenges, as the pixie magic deems anything it touches as "bad" or "corrupt."

Meanwhile, a unique baby dragon named **Avalon** hatches, imbued with a special connection to the elemental powers by the pixies' magic. Recognizing Avalon's potential threat, the pixies seal him in a dragon jail, spinning an elaborate tale to manipulate him into believing Z'Olrath is the true villain.

As Avalon grows and escapes his prison, he becomes entangled in the pixies' deception, learning to wield elemental powers under their guidance. However, a confrontation with Z'Olrath reveals the truth, forcing Avalon to choose between the pixies and the true path of righteousness. The fate of Drakonia hangs in the balance as Avalon grapples with his allegiance and discovers the true meaning of his elemental powers.
